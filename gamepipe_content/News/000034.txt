<b>Abstract</b>
When we discuss about game development, we come across disciplines like gameplay, graphics, AI, etc., but a robust online infrastructure is now an almost ubiquitous requirement for a successful title. With the growing demand of networked AAA games, performance and reliability of Online services is as important as any other aspect of the game engine, and these services go far beyond gameplay networking - covering many aspects of backend systems interaction from Social to Big Data. As representatives from the Online team at Treyarch, we will be covering details of some of our services and backend infrastructure. We will be talking about what it takes to keep these Online services running and millions of Call of Duty players connected 24/7.
