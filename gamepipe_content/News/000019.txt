<b>Abstract</b>:
We are very familiar with the typical client server architecture that powers most games. Utilizing typical Service Oriented Architecture (or SOA) as a software development paradigm for breaking up large systems into more manageable independent components has been the way of the past and is still a good model to follow. With the advent of the cloud however a new approach is becoming more popular, the MicroServices approach. This approach involves each implementing a specific API to enable event driven software for full responsiveness. Basically, Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together. This talk will go over what makes up a micro services architecture, its key benefits and how it differs from SOA.
