<b>Abstract</b>
With advancements in data technologies, the speed of getting feedback has increased many folds that allows for rapid iteration process. Game development process has shifted from “design, develop, release” to “design, develop, release, and fine tune forever”. In the game industry today, analytics is used heavily to develop strategies for monetization and long term player retention. To create successful games, great game design with high production quality is not enough to can keep millions different kind of players engaged. Game developers have to ensure that they are collecting all the data as the player interacts with each aspect of the game. Very granular game data enables diving deeper into analyzing player behaviors that can be used to predict their tenure and spend in the game. As games are a piece of art, data can best inform you on how to make a game better by highlighting the issues, it can’t create the game for you. So maintaining the balance between the science and art is key for creating highly addictive games. Data, psychology, and qualitative player feedback working together can best inform developers. Using data can get you there faster, provide unbiased feedback (depending on who is analyzing it...this isn't perfect) and help ask the right questions.
