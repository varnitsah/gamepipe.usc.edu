<b>Abstract</b>:
Expanding mobile gameplay from a small screen into the world at large offers myriad opportunities: non-linear storytelling, physical object integration, a more visceral experience, true social interaction. But each of these opportunities also presents unique challenges when compared with "traditional" mobile gaming. What are the potential rewards and pitfalls, for user and developer and even third party sponsor, of geo-gaming versus the traditional approach? To answer these questions, this talk will contrast traditional development and design practices for mobile gaming with the unique demands of geo-gaming, specifically the technological considerations including bandwidth, beacon limitations and platform restrictions. Finally, we will examine the informative user data metrics gleaned from over twenty-thousand "BattleKasters" players and discuss how this information informs not only geo-gaming, but the future of mobile gaming in general.
