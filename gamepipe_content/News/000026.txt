08/24/2016

CSCI 599 Game Development is a new course being offered in Fall semester. The syllabus is <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzcrqdl9skyvp4q/CSCI%20599%20Game%20Development.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.

The abstract for the course:

 "The course will focus on Game Design and Production and will be a project-based class, taking you through all the steps needed to build a high quality game prototype. We'll be covering various topics such as developing game worlds, statistical modeling, mobile and location-based games such as Pokémon Go, and various game production techniques throughout the entire process. The course should act as a great set up for the year long Advanced Game Projects class.”

The course is being taught by two instructors involved in the development of Pokemon Go, Khaled Abdel Rahman & Dan Airey. They have amazingly distinguished bios.

An interview with Khaled is here: <a href="http://news.usc.edu/105198/the-april-fools-joke-that-turned-into-a-global-sensation/">http://news.usc.edu/105198/the-april-fools-joke-that-turned-into-a-global-sensation/</a>
